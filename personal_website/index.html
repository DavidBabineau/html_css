    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <h2>There and Back again...</h2>

      <p>So, here's a little snippet about myself. I'm 39 and have a wonderfull
        wife and two amazing dogs. After highschool, I took ten years off to
        explore the world and after an epic journey, decided it was time for
        school again. I did it myself! Thats right, I put myself through school
        and earned a BS in Anthropology with a concentration in archeaology!</p>

        <p>I know what you're thinking, "An Archeaology degree?" Well, I have
          to say, I also wonder that myself. But like all things, I guess
          there's a reason and I suppose that reason was -- it got me to where
          I am today. Don't get me wrong, I had some amazing adventures as an
          archeaologist. I suppose the best thing of all, it lead me into the
          environmental field, where I became a project manager and had the
          opportunity to hike through most of the United States! It also lead
          me to find my amazing wife and gave me the realization that I could
          do so much more!</p>

          <p>Now here I am! After changing gears and publishing a book, I got
            involved in the video game industry, opened a business and decided
            to learn coding to take full control of my business's website and
            to offer more to my current company.</p>
